## Wishlist

1. A way to know if the site creator has unsubscribed before and shouldn't be auto subscribed again if the user creates another site.
2. ~~Settings page for selecting which users should be auto-subscribed:~~
  * ~~Site Creators - possibly useful in the multisite environments.~~
  * ~~All users added to the database - possibly useful in single site WordPress install~~
3. Support for other Subscription plugins.
4. Settings to check if email confirmation required.
